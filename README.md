### Note
- This directive is a practical solution, not a performance champion. It will not win any code efficiency competition.
- As for the moment, developments are on going, so I am not accepting pull requests. I will choose &  add them manually instead.
- If you like / use this directive in your awesome projects, star this repo. It's a huge motivation for me. Would also love to hear from you if you use it in an open source project. Thanks!
